## How it works ?

assuming you have docker and docker-compose installed, You have to be positionned on the same directory as docker-compose file and run: 

`docker-compose up -d --build`

this will command will run frontend and backend and mongo containers.

the front-end App will be available on <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>
